						LRWebs is a web development entity founded by Lwandile Rozani in November 2016, while developing PHP enabled posts
						on shared servers using spaghetti code. Things have since improved as our websites are now developed on a programming
						framework, such as Wordpress, utilising the latest technologies. Gone are the days of utilising shared hosts as VPSes (
						Virtual Private Servers) are even at times more useful and more affordable than shared hosts.
