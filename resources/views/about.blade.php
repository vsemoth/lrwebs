					<p>
						LRWebs is a web development entity founded by Lwandile Rozani in November 2016, while developing PHP enabled posts
						on shared servers using "spaghetti code". Things have since improved as our websites are now developed on a programming
						framework, such as Meteor, utilising the latest technologies. Gone are the days of utilising shared hosts as VPSes (
						Virtual Private Servers) are even at times more useful and more affordable than shared hosts.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						At LRWebs we do our best to have the best possible designs for our clients intended sites.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						We work with the intent of improving local business in broadening their prospective client base by putting
						them up on the internet. Our aim is to hereby improve the local economy and the quality of life especially
						for local entrepreneurs.
